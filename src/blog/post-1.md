Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro. Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## Steps so far:

1. **Installing Astro**: I mean, duh. Create a new _Astro_ project and set up online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: Like, creating new `.astro` files and placing 'em in the `src/pages` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: Such a meta thing to write as _this_ is my first blog post. Now I have some `.astro` pages and Markdown posts.

## What's next

Who knows? "#" the title like h1 and "##" makes 'em h2. Also wrapping the text around "_" makes it _italic_ and marks it down as "em" rather then "p".

I guess my favorite is the backtick ( \` ). Wrapping a text with these changes the style and  marks them as `code`.

* Also I nearly forgot about these beauties. But as far as the tutorial goes, I'd rather know what I say before encouraging a false mental model.

Know how do I return to my blog page, there is no Return button and the header is gone (which was written in each `.astro` page separately, lol).
